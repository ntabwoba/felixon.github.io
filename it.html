    About this course Information Technology, commonly referred to as IT, refers to the use of technology to organize, store, share, and process information. The IT industry is growing quickly as companies become more technology-based and the need to manage information becomes increasingly vital. Introduction to IT is geared towards complete beginners looking to take their first steps into the world of Information Technology. Public Telecommunications Courses Telecommunications courses can be public or private. A public course means that anyone can register, pay for and attend the training course as an individual or as part of a small group. Check if a discount is available for groups attending a public course. In-person public telecommunications courses are usually held in conference facilities in major cities, scheduled on specific dates with registration open to the public. This is also called a public seminar. Virtual or Live Online public telecommunications courses are also scheduled on specific dates with registration open to the public. The seminar is facilitated using Zoom, Teams or other videoconferencing platform over the Internet. Private Telecommunications Courses Telecom courses can also be held on-site at an organization's location for a group of their personnel. This is called a private seminar, an onsite seminar and sometimes a suitcase course. A private telecom course is organized and paid for by an employer for their team members. In a private group, the students can ask questions about and discuss the organization's specific telecom implementations. Management can get everyone up to the same speed, with a common vocabulary and frame of reference. There is an undoubted return on investment in terms of accuracy, efficiency and productivity. Private in-person telecom training for a group is also a strong team-building exercise. Private virtual telecom training for a group has the advantage of allowing widely-dispersed teams working from home to take a course together, getting up to the same speed and using a common vocabulary. A differentiator is delivery of materials to students: does the course provider offer printed course materials shipped directly to the students for virtual classes? The literature is clear that people learn more and retain more with a printed book to accompany the instruction. Seminars on Telecommunications A seminar on telecommunications means a learning environment where the students can ask questions and make comments during the instructor's presentation. This lends itself well to groups of 10 to 30 students. Studies suggest that 14 is the optimal number of students in a class for maximum learning synergy.About this course Information Technology, commonly referred to as IT, refers to the use of technology to organize, store, share, and process information.
