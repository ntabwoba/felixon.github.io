    <div>INTRODUCTION
The book will also explain the information assurance model and
the hacking framework Metasploit, taking you through important commands, exploits, and payload basics. Moving on to hashes and passwords, you will learn password testing and hacking techniques with John the Ripper and Rainbow. You will then dive into classic and modern encryption techniques where you will learn to work with the conventional cryptosystem.
In the final chapter, you will use all the skills of hacking to exploit a remote Windows and Linux system, and you will learn how to “own” a remote target entirely.
Who This Book Is For
This book is primarily for information security professionals. However, security enthusiasts and absolute beginners will also find this book helpful. For absolute beginners, knowledge of high school algebra,
the number system, and the Python programming language is a plus. However, this book provides an explanation of the foundational rules so you can understand the relationship between them and ethical hacking, information security, and the hacking-related tools of Kali Linux.
For more advanced professionals, the book also includes in-depth analysis.
Whether you are new to ethical hacking or a seasoned veteran, this book will help you understand and master many of the powerful and useful hacking-related tools of Kali Linux and the techniques that are widely used in the industry today.
To start with, you need a virtual box or virtual machine, so proceed to Chapter 1.INTRODUCTION
