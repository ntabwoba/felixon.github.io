    I wish to record my gratitude to my wife, Kaberi, for her unwavering support and encouragement in the preparation of this book.
I am extremely grateful to Mr. Matthew Moodie, lead development editor, for his numerous valuable suggestions, complementary opinions, and thorough thumbing; as well as editor Nikhil Karkal, coordinating editor Divya Modi, and the whole Apress team for their persistent support and help. I also wish to thank Vaibhav Chavan, the technical reviewer, for their valued suggestions.
In the preparation of this book, I consulted open source documentation and numerous textbooks on a variety of subjects related to ethical hacking and want to thank the countless authors who wrote them. I hereby acknowledge my special indebtedness to Nmap original author Gordon Lyon (Fyodor) and the developer of the Metasploit Framework, H.D. Moore. I am also thankful for the ever-helpful open source community.

    Introduction
You can get started in white-hat ethical hacking using Kali Linux, and this book starts you on that road by giving you an overview of security trends, where you will learn about the OSI security architecture. This will form the foundation for the rest of Beginning Ethical Hacking with Kali Linux.
With the theory out of the way, you’ll move on to an introduction to VirtualBox, networking terminologies, and common Linux commands, followed by the step-by-step procedures to build your own web server and acquire the skill to be anonymous. When you have finished the examples in the first part of your book, you will have all you need to carry out safe and ethical hacking experiments.
After an introduction to Kali Linux, you will carry out your first penetration tests with Python and code raw binary packets for use in those tests. You will learn how to find secret directories of a target system, how to use a TCP client in Python and services, and how to do port scanning using Nmap. Along the way, you will learn how to collect important information; how to track e-mail; and how to use important tools such as DMitry, Maltego, and others. You’ll also take a look at the five phases of penetration testing.
After that, this book will cover SQL mapping and vulnerability analysis where you will learn about sniffing and spoofing, why ARP poisoning is a threat, how SniffJoke prevents poisoning, how to analyze protocols with Wireshark, and how to use sniffing packets with Scapy. Then, you will learn how to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities, how to use Sqlmap, and how to do brute-force or password attacks. In addition, you will learn how to use important hacking tools such as OpenVas, Nikto, Vega, and Burp Suite.
