Instructor-Led Courses on Telecommunications
Instructor-led short courses on telecommunications are typically two to five days long.  A comprehensive 5-day (week-long) course on telecom technologies, products, services and players is often referred to as a telecom BOOT CAMP.

This type of course is typically designed as job training for non-engineering professionals, paid for by the student's employer.

"Non-engineering" means the assumptions are 1) The student is reasonably intelligent, 2) They have a desire to learn about telecom technologies, products, services and players, and 3) The training course starts at the beginning, with fundamental concepts, then mainstream technologies, explaining the jargon and buzzwords, and most importantly, the underlying ideas, and how it all fits together, while not getting bogged down with technical discussions.

The job descriptions of typical students include administrative personnel who order and coordinate services from telecom companies, sales and marketing personnel of all types, programmers and analysts, customer solution designers, finance people who have to pay for the equipment and services, managers, and anyone who has to be able to understand what the "techies" are saying.

Instructor-Led Telecommunications Course Recommendations:
The best instructor-led courses on telecommunications are from Teracom Training Institute, which has built a huge reputation for best-of-breed telecom-for-non-engineers telecom courses over more than 20 years:

Telecommunications BOOT CAMP (5 days)

Broadband Telecommunications, Datacom and Networking for Non-Engineers (3 days)

Voice over IP, SIP, Security, 5G and IoT (2 days)

Fundamentals of Telecom (2 days)

In-Person Instructor-Led Telecommunications Courses
In-person instructor-led telecommunications training in a classroom setting is the gold standard: the best kind of training you can get.  In a classroom means away from the never-ending distractions at work or working from home, enabling you to focus and learn.  You can ask questions and interact with other students.

A differentiator between training providers is the quality of the course materials.  Having a printed book with detailed notes during and after the class allows you to learn more and retain more compared to electronic copies of slides.

Another differentiator is how long the training company has been in business, and if they run scheduled public seminars. A company with little or no track record risks having incomplete and outdated courses. A training company in business for a long time and running public seminars will have the advantage of field-testing, tuning, refining and updating their course to be the current knowledge required in the telecom industry.

A third differentiator is telecommunications certification with the telecommunications training course.  Does the provider include a telecommunications certification from an organization like TCO or iNARTE with the course?

Virtual Instructor-Led Telecommunications Courses: Live Online
A virtual instructor-led telecom course, also known as Live Online or virtual telecommunications course, is the same as an in-person instructor-led telecom course, except that the instructor and students are in different locations, and the course is facilitated by Zoom, Teams or another group videoconferencing platform over the Internet.

This has the advantages of an instructor-led course: staying focused, being able to ask questions, and getting away from distractions, plus the significant advantage of being able to have employees working from home attend the course, with no travel costs.
